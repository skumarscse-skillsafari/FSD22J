    <h3><u>Headline - 1</u></h3>
    <p><strong>Contrary</strong> to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
        classical Latin
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
        Hampden-Sydney
        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
        and
        going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
        <br><strong>Lorem Ipsum
            comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil)
            by
            Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
            Renaissance.
            The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
            1.10.32.</strong>
